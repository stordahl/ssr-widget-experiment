## Goals and Motivations

The current architecture for third-party web apps relies heavily on the client device's resources. With the Streams API landing in all major browsers, I want to attempt to create a new, stream based architecture to enable massively smaller client bundles and allow for third-party apps & scripts to take full advantage of edge deployments.
